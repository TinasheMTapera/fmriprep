# flywheel/fmriprep
Build context for a [Flywheel Gear](https://github.com/flywheel-io/gears/tree/master/spec) which runs [fMRIprep](http://fmriprep.readthedocs.io). [fMRIprep](http://fmriprep.readthedocs.io) is a functional magnetic resonance image pre-processing pipeline that is designed to provide an easily accessible, state-of-the-art interface that is robust to differences in scan acquisition protocols and that requires minimal user input, while providing easily interpretable and comprehensive error and output reporting.
